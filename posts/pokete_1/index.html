Also logging has been added.</p><p><code>pipenv</code> now also is supported and enables virtual environments and dependency management.</p><p>Also some of the escapecodes have been improved.</p><h2 id=game-design-and-behaviour>Game design and behaviour

Also most of the buildings like arenas or Pokete-Center and Shops now have signs on their roofs that show, what those buildings even are.</p><p>The first new map is <a href=https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/pull/107>sunny beach</a> where the newly added weather first came into play. It&rsquo;s located in the north of Rockville is the place where the new Crabbat, Rustacean and Saugh can be found.</p><p><img src=sunnybeach.png alt="Sunny beach"></p><p>But the biggest addition is the city of <a href=https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/pull/120>Agrawos</a> and being the biggest city in the game to far. It features the MowCow-Burger restaurant with a sidequest, the temple of the Wheeto, many NPCs, an arena, a town hall and many items to find. Also a new legendary old attack on a learning disc can be found there. To quote the minimap:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>The great city of Agrawos,

And because of this strictly night and day active Poketes are now possible, so that certain Poketes can just be caught at night, and also evolve to other Poketes then their day counterparts.</p><p>Because of this a new evolving line was added, starting with Corcos which has identical day and night versions, which both evolve to Raupathor.
But Rauphators day and night versions differ, not just that the night version has some blue accents in its artwork, but that the night has <code>undead</code> and the day version has <code>plant</code> as their secondary type. They also evolve to different Poketes, the night Raupathor evolves to Mothor and the day Raupathor to Schmetterling.</p><p>One ingame hour is the same as a realtime minute, but the time ingame time will stop after idling for two minutes.
Also a big Ascii clock was added to keep track of time.</p><p><img src=clock.png alt=Clock></p><h3 id=leveling>Leveling

One notable NPC is the candyman, who will try to gift you a treat every 24 ingame hours.

The three natures effect attack defense and initiative values by a factor:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Nature</th><th>Attack</th><th>Defense</th><th>Initiative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brave</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Relaxed</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hasty</td><td>1</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This also varies by a grade what&rsquo;s either 1 or 2 and which potentiate the factors.</p><h2 id=thanks>Thanks
